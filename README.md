# ScratchWeather
Weather information on Scratch!
## How does it work?
### Fetch (or GET)
First, ScratchWeather fetches infromation from a great weather API intergrated into ScratchWeather... OpenWeather API! Then, it gets downloaded into the project, then, well, that's it.
### JSON Extract
One key thing is that ScratchWeather uses JSON for handling the JSON answer into human-readable text, which is very importatnt, because not everybody would understand JSON!
### Weather Image Code
One thing ScratchWeather shares with OpenWeather is it's weather image codes, to show pictures for weather, or a pictogram.
