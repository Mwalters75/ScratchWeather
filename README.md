Weather information on Scratch!
## How to use ScratchWeather?
First, let's talk about how to use ScratchWeather. ScratchWeather is a weather project, which aims to give you the latest weather information on Scratch!
### Fetching weather information
ScratchWeather fetches weather information from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API. We're very grateful to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for providing this service! To fetch weather information, you need to provide a city name, or a contry.
### Weather information
ScratchWeather provides you with weather information in JSON format. OpenWeatherMap provides the following information:
- **Weather**: The weather condition.
- **Temperature**: The temperature in Metric (this wasn't made in America, people!).
- **Humidity**: The humidity in percent.
- **Wind speed**: The wind speed in meters per second.
- **Wind direction**: The wind direction in degrees.

...And much more!
